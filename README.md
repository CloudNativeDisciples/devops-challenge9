# Fender Digital DevOps Engineering Challenge
Using automation tools of your choice, create a method to provision the given environment:

### Create a simple code snippet that receives a POST request 
* The **POST** method should save the time, the user name and the endpoint on a database of your choice. 

### Create a simple code snippet that receives a GET request.
* The **GET** request should read the data previously saved by the **POST** request. 
* The permissions to read the data should be limited to the user that executed the **POST** request.

### Create a simple method to install and run the code
* Install all the code dependencies
* Pack and deploy the code automatically with no downtime. 
* Everything must be run by **1 or 2 commands max**.

### Create a readme
* that explains your thinking process
* that describes how to setup and run the project
* that (if you created tests) describes how to run and execute the tests before deployment
* that describes what enhancements you would have made if you had more time.
* that lists known issues (**if any**)

### Additional Info
* You can use Rails/Sinatra, Python, Go, node.js or a shiny-new-framework X, as long as you can justify your choices
* Feel free to use whatever automation tool you like, provided we can run the set-up using on **1 or 2 commands**.
* Bonus points for security, specs, Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDb.
* In case you decide to go for Lambda, all the requirements of your project should be part of a layer.
* Feel free to use whatever db you like; we suggest Postgres or DynamoDB for NoSql.
* We expect this project to take no more than 2 days to complete (but no rush, take your time and do your best!)
* Do as little or as much as you like.
* Show your best thinking and don't frustrate yourself in case you don't finish the whole challenge. Show us what you achieved!
* Please fork this repo and commit your code into that fork. Show your work and process through the commits.
